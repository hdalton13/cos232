Part 1: Bounds Checking
	1)  From step 3: what happens when you exclude the p from the input string above? Why?
		Its getting the null byte.
	
Part 2: Non-executable Stack
	2)  What difference did the -z execstack flag make?
		The -z flag recognizes the keyword execstacks which then marks the object as requiring an executable stack.
		
	3)  What is the risk in setting the stack executable?
		The risk of setting a stack executable is that other users can set different things and try running it.
		
Part 3: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
	4)  From step 3: what is different?
		Just the addresses are different from each of the .txt files
	5)  From step 4: what is different?
		There is no difference between these two text files
		
Part 4: Stack Canaries
	6)  What happened when you tried the attack?
		The code aborted from running the program. 
	7)  Can you identify how the canary is added to the stack?
		The canary is added to the stack by placeing a small integer.
	8)  What is the basic logic used to set and check the canary value?
		First its moving the value from %fs to the %rax. Then we move the %rax value to the %rbp. Next the code is run. Finally, after running the code the canary is checked to see if its value was changed. 
	9)  What is the value of the canary?
	10) (Bonus) How is the canary value obtained?
