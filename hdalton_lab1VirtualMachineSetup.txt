1) What is the purpose of sending your public key to the instructor?
	By sending our public key to the instructor it allows us to have access to our virtual 	matchine via our current computer.
2) Why did you not have to enter a password? Can anyone get into your virtual machine?
	A)The reason that I could get into my virtual machine without the password is because I 	have the private key that allows me access.
	B)No, the only reason they would is if they found out my personal information and 		breatched my confidentiality. 
3) What is your current username on the remote virtual machine?
	root@secfarm-106
4) Is the output from getent different? How?
	The output is different after going through those two steps because it adds the new user 		that I created.
5) Why did we add your username to the sudo group?
	By adding ourself to the sudo group it allows us to access the authority of root without 		being logged into root
6) What is your current username on the remote virtual machine?
	hdalton@secfarm-106
