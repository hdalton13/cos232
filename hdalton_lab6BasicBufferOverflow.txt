1)  What is the purpose of the -g command line flag for gcc?
	The -g flag provides extra debugging information that only GDB can use. In other words -g adds debugging information.
	
2)  List the sizes of all local variables (in bytes)
	print sizeof(status) -->  4
	print sizeof(buf) --> 24
	print sizeof(user_input) -->  4
	print sizeof(i) -->  4

3)  List the addresses of all local variables (in bytes)
	print &status --> (int *) 0x7fffffffe4b8
	print &buf --> (int (*)[6]) 0x7fffffffe4a0
	print &user_input --> (int *) 0x7fffffffe49c
	print &i --> (int *) 0x7fffffffe4bc

4)  Predict what index of buf is the address of status?
	I predict that the address of status is at index 0 of buf 
	
5)  What user input to buff will result in an overflow?
	Overflow will occur when a user inputs data to buf[7].
	
6)  Take a photo of your drawing and upload it with your solutions

7)  What is the value of i? Why?
8)  How did you fix the source code to remedy this buffer overflow vulnerability?
