1) What is stored in the /tmp/passwd file?
	From what it looks like the passwd file contains the username and encrypted passwords. It looks like:
		hdalton:$apr1$1.Znl3Fs$0cnrcpNEUKWbkQLcQBdqm1
		bob:$apr1$ETF7PmM4$6jxb02NZ3fRNcX.7nyg5X0
		eve:$apr1$NxOgTv0b$eR25GWOgAs.pXOueLaXpH/

2) What cryptographic hashing algorithm is htpasswd using?
	htpasswd is using apr1 hashing.
	
3) What is the purpose of the john command? Briefly describe in your own words how it works.
	a) John is ment to look at the users passwords and see if they are weak.
	b) Basically john will look into a password file and decrypt the user's passwords. Once it does that john print the password to a file and keeps track that the password was already cracked.
	
4) Were you able to crack the password? Did the length of the password matter?
	a) The website CrackStation was able to crack the password.
	b) The length does matter.
	
5) Was the password vulnerable because sha256 is weak?
	The password was not vulnerable becasue of sha256. 
	
6) Why is that password compromised?
      Note: see CrackStationâ€™s description (Links to an external site.) of the word list
      It is vulnerable because it was common english words.
      
7) Did salting help prevent the password from being cracked? Why or why not?
	Salting the password did prevent the password from being cracked because it added etra random data.
	 
8) In our example, is the password mysupersecretsaltsadsonnysdaughter?
	Yes
	
9) If encoding is similar to hashing (and encryption) what is wrong with using it for storing sensitieve information (such as a password)?
	Storing sensitive information in encoding leaves a big vulnerability because it easier to decode an encoding rather than a hash by just going through different bases.
	
10) Was a secret key required to decode the base64 encoded password?
	No secret key was required to decode the base 64 encoded password.
