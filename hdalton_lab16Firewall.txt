1)  What is netfilter and nft?
	A nft is a commandline tool that allows the iser to inspect packet filtering and classification rules in a Linux Kernal. While from what I understand a Netfilter (nf) is the subsystem of the Linux kernel. This could allow a user to get the table of information.
	
2)  What is the name of our table and chain?
	a) Name of Table= ip
	b) Name of Chain= input
	
3)  What tcp connections are established?
	 6 431999 ESTABLISHED src=10.121.218.16 dst=10.121.20.106 sport=37434 dport=22 src=10.121.20.106 dst=10.121.218.16 sport=22 dport=37434 [ASSURED] mark=0 use=1

4)  What would happen if we didn’t add this rule?
	If we didn't add this rule then it wouldn't let anything through the builder.

5)  What is the source port and destination port for the connection to placekitten.com
	Source Port: 80
	Destination Port: 80
	
	Output from command
		Resolving placekitten.com (placekitten.com)... 172.67.180.80, 104.18.52.172, 104.18.53.172, ...
Connecting to placekitten.com (placekitten.com)|172.67.180.80|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

6)  How would we change the expression to match UDP desination port 22?
	By adding a dport 22 at the end of the command.
	
7)  What command did you use to add the rule for http?
	sudo nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 80 accept
	
8)  Are the same ports open as before? Why or why not?
	Yes they are all still open because I whitlisted them.
	 
9)  Why didn’t we set the policy to drop when we created the chain?
	The reason we didn't set the policy to drop when we created the chain is becasue we didn't know which ones we wanted to allow verses not allow. 

10) (challenge question) Can you construct a rule that rejects all network traffic from Bob?
	*from what I understand this is extra credit



-L --dump
